1) In folder where code is, create a folder called data. This is where the json files get created.


2) Run the code with python 3. Because I am running the code with Python 3 I had to change the print statements from print "test" to print("test") That is all I changed.
I went with Python3 because I was getting a byte string error with Python 2.7.

To start the twitter collection:
python3 streaming.py

3) The code dumps JSON files into the data folder.
For scaling reference:
For DC/Baltimore area: At 9pm on Thursday the rate for geo-tweets was 400 tweets every 4.5 mins ~ 1MB JSON.

4) To work with the JSON files
